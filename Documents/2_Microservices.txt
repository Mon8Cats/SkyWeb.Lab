1) What are microservies?
Small, independent, loosly coupled services
Separate codebase
Deployed independently 
Own database 
Well-defined APIs
Technology agnostic 

2) Monolithic Architecture 
Single codebase
Easy to develop, debug, deployments
Complexity (big codebase)
Hard to maintenene 
Challenge of making changes 
Inability to apply new technology 

3) Micsrovervices Architecture 
Independent services 
Scalability 
Technology diversity
Agility
Small, focused teams 
Challenge of transaction management and traceability

4) Monolithic vs Microsevices Architecture
